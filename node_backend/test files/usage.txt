This is the usage part of how to run a node js file from the scratch. Because of my background 
the learning curve seems to be really fast and the efficiency is also high.

- install node.js
-create a dir for your project and create an index.js file
-npm init to initalize the folder
-this will also load the modules dir which contains all the modules.
-you can later use git init to configure your project to github. However modules folder should not be there.
-pacakge.json contains the file for all the packages you have installed and package-lock.json consists of the 
dependendies used by those packages.
-npm install express --save to install express in the given directory. 
--npm install -g nodemon for autorun the changes.
